        If the object created by the constructor needs to be cleaned up at the
        end of the context lifetime, it possible to do so in a separate
        *destructor*. That callable will receive three parameters:

        - The Context object,
        - whatever the constructor had returned, and
        - an exception, that was caught during the lifetime of the context. This
          last value is `None`, if the Context was destroyed without exception.

        The value returned by the constructor will be *cached* in the Context
        object by default, i.e. the constructor will be called at most once for
        each Context. It is possible to add a context member, which will be
        called every time it is accessed by passing a `False` value as the
        *cached* parameter. Note that the destructor will only receive two
        parameters in this case (the context object and the optional exception).
